# Calculator ðŸ§®

- In this Project I learned how to use Functions with outputs!

A user-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The calculator supports continuous calculations and allows users to restart with new inputs at any point.

## Features
- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Allows users to chain calculations using the result of the previous calculation.
- Automatically restarts for a new calculation session.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a terminal:
   ```bash
   main.py
